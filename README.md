## Overview of Project ##
The purpose of this project is to analyze a large cross-section of stock ticker and volume data for various companies to help determine their returns in the years 2017 and 2018. 

## Analysis and Challenges ##

When analyzing the data, I found that in 2017, the company RUN had the best return at productions had the highest probability of being successful, as shown below:

Conversely, in 2018, it appears that a vast majority of the companies had a negative return on investment, as shown here:

This is further shown when analyzing the percentages of failed vs successful theater kickstarters, as shown below. I ran into difficulty attempting to sort the pivot chart correctly and was unable to remedy it.

## Conclusion ##

Based on our findings, we recommend that Louise begin a kickstarter goal in May for a theater play production. Conversely, the theater outcomes chart shows that this type of kickstarter failing or succeeding is fairly equal when attempted in December. From the outcomes based on goal chart, we can determine that the highest successful percentage of kickstarters were for plays ranging from $1,000 to $4,999 goal. However, it is worth noting that the data set is limited by the years available (2011, 2014-2017) and we would need additional charts regarding any fundraising done during the missing years.
